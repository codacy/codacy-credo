Files should end in a trailing blank line.

This is mostly for historical reasons: every text file should end with a \n,
or newline since this acts as `eol` or the end of the line character.

Most text editors ensure this "final newline" automatically.

Like all `Readability` issues, this one is not a technical concern.
But you can improve the odds of others reading and liking your code by making
it easier to follow.
