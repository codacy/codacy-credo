Module attribute names are always written in snake_case in Elixir.

    # snake_case

    @inbox_name "incoming"

    # not snake_case

    @inboxName "incoming"

Like all `Readability` issues, this one is not a technical concern.
But you can improve the odds of others reading and liking your code by making
it easier to follow.
