Cyclomatic complexity (CC) is a software complexity metric closely
correlated with coding errors.

If a function feels like it's gotten too complex, it more often than not also
has a high CC value. So, if anything, this is useful to convince team members
and bosses of a need to refactor parts of the code based on "objective"
metrics.
